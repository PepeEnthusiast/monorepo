A web application for creating, storing and sending non-fungible tokens on Litecoin. Built using the [Bitcoin Computer](http://bitcoincomputer.io/).

**This app is under heavy development and not ready for production use.**

## Installation

Install the [Bitcoin Computer Monorepo](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo). Then navigate from the root folder of the monorepo to the folder ``packages/non-fungible-token``.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-computer/monorepo.git
cd monorepo
lerna bootstrap
cd packages/non-fungible-token
```

## Usage

### Deploy the Smart Contract

Before you can run the app you need to deploy the smart contract. To do so run
```bash
yarn deploy
```

You will need to fund the wallet that is used to deploy the smart contract, see [here](../lib/README.md#fund-the-wallet).

Once the smart contract is deployed the deploy script will give you instructions to copy some lines of code into the file "App.js". After that you can start the server.

### Start the Server

To start the application run
```bash
yarn start
```
and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

### Log In

To log into the application you need a BIP39 seed phrase. You can generate a new seed for example from [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

### Configuration

The application defaults to testnet mode. You can run it in regtest or mainnet mode you can run a [Bitcoin Computer Node][node]. To configure the web app to connect to your own node, have a look at the comment at the top of "App.js". Support for mainnet will be added soon.

### Fund the Wallet

You need to send some cryptocurrency to your wallet address to mint or send a token. Click on "Wallet" to find your wallet address.

If you run the application in testnet mode you can fund the wallet for free using a Litecoin faucet ([here](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/) or [here](http://litecointf.salmen.website/)).

If you run on regtest mode you can run
```
yarn fund-ltc <your wallet address>
```
to fund your wallet for free from the [Bitcoin Computer Node][node].
