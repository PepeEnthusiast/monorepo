# Fungible Token

An application for minting, storing, and sending fungible tokens on Litecoin. Build with the [Bitcoin Computer](http://bitcoincomputer.io). You can find more information in the accompanying [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@clemensley/how-to-build-a-token-on-bitcoin-in-javascript-c2439cf1b273).

## Installation

Install the [Bitcoin Computer Monorepo](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo). Then navigate from the root folder of the monorepo to the folder ``packages/fungible-token``.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-computer/monorepo.git
cd monorepo
lerna bootstrap
cd packages/fungible-token
cp .env.example .env
```

## Usage

### Start the Server

To start the application run the command below and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

```bash
yarn start
```

### Log In

To log into the application you need a BIP39 seed phrase. You can generate a new seed for example from [here](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/).

### Configuration

The application defaults to testnet mode. To run it in regtest or mainnet mode you can run a [Bitcoin Computer Node][node]. To configure the web app to connect to your own node, have a look at the comment at the top of "App.tsx". Support for mainnet will be added soon.

### Fund the Wallet

You need to send some cryptocurrency to your wallet address to mint or send a token. Click on "Wallet" to find your wallet address.

If you run the application in testnet mode you can send free testnet coins to your wallet address from a Litecoin faucet ([here](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/) or [here](http://litecointf.salmen.website/)).

If you run on regtest mode you can send free regtest coins by running
```
yarn fund-ltc
```
from the [Bitcoin Computer Node][node].
