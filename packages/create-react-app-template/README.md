## Installation

Install the [Bitcoin Computer Monorepo](https://github.com/bitcoin-computer/monorepo) and navigate from the root folder of the monorepo to this folder.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-computer/monorepo.git
cd monorepo
lerna bootstrap
cd packages/create-react-app-template
```

## Usage

Most of the api is documented in the [Create React App Readme](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This readme only documents the additional features for the [Bitcoin Computer](https://docs.bitcoincomputer.io/).

### Start the Application

To start the application run
```bash
yarn start
```
and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser.

### Run the tests

To start the tests
```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuration

The application defaults to testnet mode. You can run it in regtest or mainnet mode you can run a [Bitcoin Computer Node][node]. To configure the web app to connect to your own node, have a look at the comment at the top of "App.js". Support for mainnet will be added soon.

### Fund the Wallet

You need to send some cryptocurrency to your wallet address to mint or send a token. Click on "Wallet" to find your wallet address.

If you run the application in testnet mode you can fund the wallet for free using a Litecoin faucet ([here](https://testnet-faucet.com/ltc-testnet/) or [here](http://litecointf.salmen.website/)).

If you run on regtest mode you can run
```
yarn fund-ltc <your wallet address>
```
to fund your wallet for free from the [Bitcoin Computer Node][node].
